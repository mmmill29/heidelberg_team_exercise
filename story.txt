Team Heidelberg story
Bobby HiedelBerg arrived at a Flughafen in Berlin wearing only Liederhose and a single sock.
The klimaanlage in the flughafen was on high that day and he soon became a bit chilly.
Shivering, he waved to the waiter and asked if they sold any hot gebaecks.
The waiter said no, but it was still early at the baeckerei.
The manager walked by wearing a Rammstein t-shirt and told Bobby they did have some fresh Brot.
