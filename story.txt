Team Heidelberg story
Bobby HiedelBerg arrived at a Flughafen in Berlin wearing only Liederhose and a single sock.
The klimaanlage in the flughafen was on high that day and he soon became a bit chilly.
Shivering, he waved to the waiter and asked if they sold any hot gebaecks.
The waiter said no, but it was still early at the baeckerei.
The manager walked by wearing a Rammstein t-shirt and told Bobby they did have some fresh Brot.
Bobby, smelling the fresh baked brot, decided he needed something sweeter and ordered an apfelkuchen.
As soon as Bobby got it, a hund came up and took a big bite out of it.
The dog started running away so bobby got in his BMW and chsed the dog to Eltz.
Before long, Bobby's car broke down on the side of the hauptstrasse.
