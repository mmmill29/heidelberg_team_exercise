Team Heidelberg story
Bobby HiedelBerg arrived at a Flughafen in Berlin wearing only Liederhose and a single sock.
The klimaanlage in the flughafen was on high that day and he soon became a bit chilly.
Shivering, he waved to the waiter and asked if they sold any hot gebaecks.
The waiter said no, but it was still early at the baeckerei.
